# Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate - Hypothesis Testing Projects 🔬📊

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I showcase the hypothesis testing performed as part of the end-of-course projects for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. Each project involved applying hypothesis testing methods to real-world data scenarios. Below is a summary of the hypothesis testing work conducted in each project, with links to detailed Python notebooks and executive summaries.

## 1. Automatidata - NYC Taxi Fare Prediction 🚖💵

### 📚 **Hypothesis Testing Overview:**
In this project, I applied hypothesis testing to determine the most appropriate method for estimating taxi fares. The goal was to validate our regression model by comparing it against baseline assumptions.

### 🔍 **Testing Details:**
- **Hypothesis Tested**: Whether the regression model significantly improves fare predictions compared to a simple mean model.
- **Method Used**: Two-sample t-test to compare mean fares predicted by the model and observed fares.

### 📈 **Deliverables:**
- Well-commented Python notebook with hypothesis testing code
- Executive summary PowerPoint with findings

## 2. TikTok - Claims Classification Model 📱🔍

### 📚 **Hypothesis Testing Overview:**
For the TikTok project, hypothesis testing was used to evaluate the effectiveness of different classification methods for user reports. The aim was to assess whether the model's predictions were significantly better than random classification.

### 🔍 **Testing Details:**
- **Hypothesis Tested**: Whether the predictive model significantly improves classification accuracy compared to a random classifier.
- **Method Used**: Chi-square test for independence to assess the relationship between predicted and actual classifications.

### 📈 **Deliverables:**
- Well-commented Python notebook with hypothesis testing code
- Executive summary PowerPoint with findings

## 3. Waze - User Churn Prediction 🗺️📉

### 📚 **Hypothesis Testing Overview:**
In the Waze project, hypothesis testing was employed to validate factors contributing to user churn. The objective was to determine if specific user behaviors were significantly associated with higher churn rates.

### 🔍 **Testing Details:**
- **Hypothesis Tested**: Whether specific user behaviors (e.g., reduced app usage) significantly correlate with higher churn rates.
- **Method Used**: Logistic regression analysis to test the impact of various factors on churn probability.

### 📈 **Deliverables:**
- Well-commented Python notebook with hypothesis testing code
- Executive summary PowerPoint with findings
