# Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate - Hypothesis Testing Projects 🔬📊

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I showcase the hypothesis testing performed as part of the end-of-course projects for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. Each project involved applying hypothesis testing methods to real-world data scenarios. Below is a summary of the hypothesis testing work conducted in each project, with links to detailed Python notebooks and executive summaries.

## 1. Automatidata - A/B Testing for Taxi Fare Prediction 🚖💵

### 📚 **Hypothesis Testing Overview:**
In this project, the focus was on demonstrating knowledge of preparing, creating, and analyzing A/B tests. The goal was to determine if there is a significant difference in taxi fare amounts based on the payment method.

### 🔍 **Testing Details:**
- **Purpose**: To analyze whether the method of payment (credit card vs. cash) affects the fare amount. The test aimed to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
- **Hypothesis Tested**:
  - **Null Hypothesis ( \( H_0 \) )**: There is no difference in the average fare amount between customers who use credit cards and those who use cash.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis ( \( H_A \) )**: There is a difference in the average fare amount between customers who use credit cards and those who use cash.
- **Method Used**: Two-sample t-test (independent samples t-test) to compare the mean fare amounts between the two payment groups.

### 📈 **Deliverables:**
- Well-commented Python notebook with hypothesis testing code
- Executive summary PowerPoint with findings

## 2. TikTok - Views Analysis for Verified vs. Unverified Accounts 📱🔍

### 📚 **Hypothesis Testing Overview:**
For the TikTok project, the aim was to demonstrate the ability to prepare, create, and analyze hypothesis tests. The goal was to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in the number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified and unverified accounts.

### 🔍 **Testing Details:**
- **Purpose**: To apply descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze view counts for TikTok videos and determine if account verification status affects video views.
- **Hypothesis Tested**:
  - **Null Hypothesis ( \( H_0 \) )**: There is no difference in the number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and those posted by unverified accounts.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis ( \( H_A \) )**: There is a difference in the number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and those posted by unverified accounts.
- **Method Used**: Two-sample t-test (independent samples t-test) to compare the mean number of views between the two groups of accounts.

### 📈 **Deliverables:**
- Well-commented Python notebook with hypothesis testing code
- Executive summary PowerPoint with findings

## 3. Waze - User Churn and Device Usage 📉🗺️

### 📚 **Hypothesis Testing Overview:**
In the Waze project, the focus was on demonstrating knowledge of conducting two-sample hypothesis tests. The goal was to test if there is a significant difference in the average number of drives between users with iPhone devices and those with Android devices.

### 🔍 **Testing Details:**
- **Purpose**: To apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to determine if device type (iPhone vs. Android) affects the number of drives.
- **Hypothesis Tested**:
  - **Null Hypothesis ( \( H_0 \) )**: There is no difference in the average number of drives between drivers who use iPhone devices and those who use Android devices.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis ( \( H_A \) )**: There is a difference in the average number of drives between drivers who use iPhone devices and those who use Android devices.
- **Method Used**: Two-sample t-test (independent samples t-test) to compare the mean number of drives between the two device groups.

### 📈 **Deliverables:**
- Well-commented Python notebook with hypothesis testing code
- Executive summary PowerPoint with findings
